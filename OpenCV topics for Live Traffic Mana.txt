OpenCV topics for Live Traffic Management System 
1) Core operations 
   Image and Video I/O :- cv2.imread(), cv2.imwrite(), cv2.VideoCapture(),cv2.VideoWriter()
   Basic Image Manipulation :- cv2.resize(), cv2.flip(), cv2,cvtColor().

2) Image Processing
   Color Spaces: cv2.cvtColor() (e.g., BGR to Grayscale, BGR to HSV)
   Different color spaces help isolate features (e.g., HSV for red traffic signs).
   Used in detecting stop signs by filtering red in HSV, simplifying lane detection with grayscale.
   
   Filtering and Smoothing : cv2.GaussianBlur(), cv2.medianBlur()
   Reduces noise in live feeds, improving edge detection and contour accuracy.
   Used in smoothing frames before detecting lanes or vehicles.

   Thresholding: cv2.threshold(), cv2.inRange()
   Segments images based on intensity or color (e.g., isolating moving objects or signs).
   Used in Thresholding for vehicle detection (background subtraction) or sign color isolation.

3) Edge and Line Detection
   Edge Detection: cv2.Canny()
   Identifies lane boundaries and object edges in real-time.
   Used in finding lane lines in the road ROI.

   Hough Transform: cv2.HoughLinesP()
   Detects straight lines (e.g., lanes) from edge data.
   used in drawing lane lines on processed frames.

4) Contour Detection and Analysis
   Contours: cv2.findContours(), cv2.contourArea(), cv2.boundingRect(), cv2.approxPolyDP()
   Identifies and analyzes shapes (e.g., vehicles, signs).
   Used in Detecting vehicle shapes after background subtraction, recognizing octagonal stop signs.

   Drawing Shapes: cv2.rectangle(), cv2.line(), cv2.putText()
   Visualizes detected objects and annotations on live frames.
   Used in drawing bounding boxes around vehicles, lane lines, and text alerts (e.g., “Congestion”).

5) Video Processing
   Frame-by-Frame Processing: cap.read(), cv2.waitKey(), cv2.imshow()
   Handles live video streams in a loop for real-time analysis.
   used in Processing each frame from a webcam or traffic camera.
   
   Background Subtraction: cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()
   Isolates moving objects (e.g., vehicles) from static backgrounds.
   used in Detecting vehicles in live traffic feeds.

6) Region of Interest (ROI)
   Masking: cv2.bitwise_and(), cv2.fillPoly()
   Why: Focuses processing on specific areas (e.g., the road).
   Use Case: Defining a trapezoid ROI for lane detection, ignoring sky or sidewalks.

7) Real-Time Optimization
   Performance Tuning
   Concepts: Frame skipping, resolution adjustment
   Why: Ensures the system runs fast enough for live use (15-30 FPS).
   Use Case: Resizing frames or skipping frames to maintain real-time performance.

8) Text and Annotations
   Topic: Adding Text
   Functions: cv2.putText()
   Why: Displays traffic metrics or alerts on the video feed.
   Use Case: Showing “Congestion Detected” or vehicle counts on the live stream.

9) Integration with External Tools (Optional for Web App)
   Topic: Frame Encoding
   Functions: cv2.imencode()
   Why: Converts frames to a format (e.g., JPEG) for web streaming.
   Use Case: Streaming processed video to a Flask web app.
